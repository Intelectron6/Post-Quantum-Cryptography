# Post-Quantum-Cryptography
Python implementations of some popular Lattice based Post Quantum Cryptography schemes. 

1) Simple scheme based on Learning With Errors problem.
2) NewHope scheme based on Ring Learning With Errors problem (q = 13229, N = 1024).
3) CRYSTALS-KYBER scheme based on Module Learning With Errors problem (q = 3329, N = 256, k = 2).

These codes are only to help understand the key-generation, encryption and decryption functions and the utility of Number Theoretic Transform.
