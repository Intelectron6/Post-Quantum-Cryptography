# Post-Quantum-Cryptography
Python implementations of some popular Lattice based Post Quantum Cryptography schemes. 

1) Simple scheme based on Learning With Errors problem (n = 128).
2) NewHope scheme based on Ring Learning With Errors problem (q = 12289, n = 512).
3) CRYSTALS-KYBER scheme based on Module Learning With Errors problem (q = 3329, n = 256, k = 2).

These codes are only to help understand the key-generation, encryption and decryption functions and the utility of Number Theoretic Transform.
