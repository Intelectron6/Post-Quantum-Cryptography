# Post-Quantum-Cryptography
Python implementations of some popular Lattice based Post Quantum Cryptography schemes. 

1) PQC scheme based on Learning With Errors (LWE) problem [n = 128].
2) PQC scheme based on Ring Learning With Errors (R-LWE) problem [q = 12289, n = 512].
3) PQC scheme based on Module Learning With Errors (M-LWE) problem [q = 7681, n = 256, k = 2].

These codes are only to help understand the key-generation, encryption and decryption functions and the utility of Number Theoretic Transform.
